					<h3>Step 1</h3>

				<p>	
					Buy Chocolates and flowers. Both men and women love being gifted these. A bouquet and box for the lady and a single bar and a flower for the gentleman.

					<h3>Step 2</h3>
				</div>
				<p>	
					Keep an open mind in the conversation, listen intently and try to truly understand the other person. Use humour. If possible, try going to quiet places with soft ambient lighting.

					<h3>Step 3</h3>

				<p>	
					The kiss! If your evening had a good dose of laughter and merriment, a passionate kiss is a good option. If it was more of soft talks and coy glances, go for a sweet and light kiss.
